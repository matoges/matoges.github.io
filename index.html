        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-normal w-full flex-grow">I was born in a region located between the 36th parallel south and the 61st meridian west. My childhood was full of joy and excitement, thanks to the beautiful surroundings of Bolívar, the place where I grew up. Even though I no longer live there, it will always hold a special place in my heart.<br/>
          It was during my time in the city of La Plata that I not only gained the knowledge and skills that have made me the professional I am today, but also met my life partner. She has given me more than I could ever ask for, and I am grateful for her every day.<br/>
          Now, more than 10 years later, I find myself living in Dresden, Germany, with my two incredible daughters. I am not the greatest soccer player, but I enjoy playing nonetheless. My passion for photography has grown over the years, and I am constantly striving to improve in all aspects of my life.<br/>
          This is just a glimpse into who I am. There is much more to discover, and I look forward to sharing it with you.
